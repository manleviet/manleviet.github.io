This site provides the documentation of the following Java libraries and apps:

1. [CA-CDR-V2]
2. [CECore]
3. [KBStatistics]
4. [FMGen]

To use **CA-CDR-V2** and **CECore** libraries, please first follow the guide in [Get packages].

## Used by

**CA-CDR-V2** and **CECore** are used by the following projects:

1. [FMTesting] - A Eclipse plug-in for feature model testing and debugging
2. A Python implementation of **CA-CDR-V2**'s algorithms can be found in [FlamaPy]
3. A Restful Webservice for developing product configurators with the following state-of-art technologies:
    - Domain reduction - decreases options that a user can select on the basis of previous selections of the user
    - Matrix Factorization-based Configuration and Recommendation - identifies Value Variable Heuristics on the basis of user requirements
    - Reordering the order of component's options on the basis of the Value Variable Heuristic
    - Conflict and diagnosis detection
